## Summary

The Digital Investment Office manages funding for capital investments products that aim to improve digital services for British Columbians. Ministries that are awarded funding must submit quarterly reports detailing their delivery performance. The current process is manual and involves filling out spreadsheets and submitting those reports via email. The current process is time consuming and results in data that is difficult to quantify and analyze due to its subjective nature.

There is a lack of clear business rules surrounding the current reports and each user interprets fields differently. Many users do not understand why all sections of a report are included and have a narrow focus on their area of understanding. This results in miscommunication and inconsistencies in how reports are filled out. This can also add to the time it takes to submit a report due to a lot of back-and-forth between PMs and Portfolio Managers to finalize details of a report.

The current reporting system supports the waterfall method best and does not adapt well to agile projects. Many agile teams find the traditional reporting methods invasive.

#### Pain Points:

- Inconsistent data that is difficult to analyze
- Time consuming to track if milestone dates are changed between reports
- Agile teams find current reporting method invasive
