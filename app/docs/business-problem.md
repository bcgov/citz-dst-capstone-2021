## Summary

The Digital Investment Office reports to the Office of the Chief Information Officer and manages funding for capital investments products that aim to improve digital services for British Columbians. Ministries that are awarded funding must submit quarterly reports detailing their project’s performance. The current manual process involves filling out spreadsheets and submitting those reports via email. This process is time consuming and results in data that is difficult to quantify and analyze due to its subjective nature.

The current reporting process supports the waterfall method best and does not adapt well to agile projects. Many agile teams find the traditional reporting methods are not ideal for getting an accurate snapshot of how a project is performing.

There is an absence of data captured in the current quarterly reporting process that objectively measures how a project is performing against its expected outcomes. Health of a project is currently measured based on the Ministry Submitter’s interpretation using color statuses. Furthermore, percent complete for a project or milestones is entered based on the Submitter’s interpretation; there is no formula to calculate progress in the existing process.

There is a lack of clear business rules surrounding the current reports and each user interprets fields differently. Many users do not understand why all sections of a report are included and have a narrow focus on their area of understanding. This results in miscommunication and inconsistencies in how reports are filled out. This can also add to the time it takes to submit a report due to a lot of back-and-forth between PMs and Portfolio Managers to finalize details of a report.


#### Pain Points:

- Capturing reporting data in excel sheet results in data that is difficult to analyze.
- Time consuming to track if estimated completion dates are changed between reports.
- Lack of objective and measurable data captured in reports that reflect how a project is performing against its expected outcomes.
- Progress for a project is manually determined by the Submitter. Due to this, percent complete of a project has little meaning outside of how far the Submitter feels they are in a project.
- Agile teams find current reporting method does not accurately capture the performance of an Agile project.
