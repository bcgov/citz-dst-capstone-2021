CITZ-DST Reporting and Dashboard System Improvement Application

## Introduction

OCIO-DIO is the BC Governments central Digital Investment Branch within the Office of the CIO. The DIOs mandate includes:

## Problem Statement
The OCIO-DIO manages capital funding for projects that aim to improve digital services for British Columbians. Ministries that are awarded funding must report their project performance quarterly.

Currently, this is a time consuming manual process which can result in data inconsistencies that become a barrier to timely and quality data analysis.

## Hypothesis

Developing a web application to support stakeholders in the quarterly reporting process will assist in improving workflows and data quality.

Utilizing a digital form to capture data from submitters can facilitate effective and efficient reporting through the use of pre-filled fields and form validation. 

Opportunities for automating data aggregation can be acted upon through the use of a database to store reporting data. Furthermore, stored data can then be surfaced into a dashboard system to help ensure decision makers and other stakeholders have access to the information they need when they need it.
